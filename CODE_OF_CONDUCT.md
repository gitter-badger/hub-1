# Code of Conduct

In recent years, conferences and meetups have attracted more developers than
ever before. As you might imagine, that many more people is that many more
opinions. In order to be respectful and kind, some opinions, some times, should
be kept to one's own; which is why these conferences and meetups formed and
adopted a _Code of Conduct_.

For our Hub and meetups, we will adopt the same. To learn exactly what it is,
please see the following:
